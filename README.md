#### **What is Jenkins Configuration as Code?**
The Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC) feature defines Jenkins configuration parameters in a human-readable YAML file that can be stored as source code.  
This essentially captures the configuration parameters and values that are used when configuring Jenkins from the web UI.

#### **What is Dcoker-Compose?**
Docker Compose is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container applications.  
With Compose, we can create a YAML file to define the services and with a single command, can spin everything up or tear it all down.
